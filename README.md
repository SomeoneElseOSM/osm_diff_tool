OpenStreetMap Hall Monitor
==========================

This module is a passive changeset monitoring tool for use with OpenStreetMap.

To begin use, simply call `import osmhm` after installation.

More information will be coming soon and the tool will continue to be improved, including the option to remove the dependency on psycopg2 and a postgres database to store everything.

If you are interested in helping with development and want to discuss things "big picture", please [contact me](mailto:ethan-nelson@users.noreply.github.com).
